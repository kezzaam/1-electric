We absolutely loved working with them and would highly recommend.\n\nThe detail in their work is amazing, the lights in our main gym area are the focal point and had to be straight and level. They did an amazing job accomplishing this, and the gym looks like a totally new space with all their work.\n\nThe finer detail with all the wires that are out of the way is amazing â€“ they are all bound up nice and tidy. We had a time constraint and they smashed out this job within this time, even doing some late shifts to make sure it was done.\n\nWe are super thankful and highly recommend 1 Electric for great detailed work on time.\"",
